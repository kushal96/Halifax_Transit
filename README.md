# Bus Tracker  
  
This application is developed by using the concept of application "Transit". This application shows users the public bus positions in Halifax city with their current location.  It will work exactly like Transit but with limited functionalities. 

### Tech Details  
Android Studio API level - 23  
Minimum Android version required - Android Marshmallow(6.0)  
Internet connection is not required for using this application . 
GPS should be on while using this application  

### Functionalities
Through my application users can  see the current realtime location of buses running across Halifax. The users can also be able to see their own current location.
Moreover, they  can also see the bus numbers in markers by clicking on bus icons.

### Steps to install
Users have to install the application for using it and after the installation users will be asked for permission only once for their location
and then they will not be asked. So, when users are asked for the first time after accepting they have to press the "center" button and they
will get their current location and buses. Then the application will always load the Halifax map and current location without any permission.  

### Bugs
I started implmenting shared preferences but afterwards some functionalities stopped working. So, I will consider maintainance of lifecycle for future enhancements
